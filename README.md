# Full-Stack Web Developer Course with AI Integration

## Overview

This comprehensive full-stack web developer course is designed to serve absolute
beginners while also providing valuable content for intermediate and advanced
developers. The curriculum integrates artificial intelligence in two key ways:

1. **AI for Learning**: Using AI to explain difficult concepts, generate examples, quizzes, code scaffolds, analogies, and provide real-time feedback.

2. **AI for Development**: Teaching students how to leverage AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and AI-assisted IDEs during the actual software development lifecycleâ€”planning, coding, debugging, testing, and deploying.

The course follows a progressive, project-based approach that builds skills incrementally, with each module building upon previous knowledge. By the end of the course, students will have created multiple real-world projects, culminating in a comprehensive full-stack application that demonstrates their mastery of both traditional development skills and AI-enhanced workflows.
